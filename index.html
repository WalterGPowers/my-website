            <h2>World of Warcraft Classes</h2>
            <h3>Warrior</h3>
            <img src="images/Warrior/Landuron.jpg" width="500 px" alt="This is a Fury Warrior">
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/character/us/area-52/landuron/">Battlelord
                        Landuron</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>For as long as war has raged, heroes from every race have aimed to master the art of battle. Warriors
                combine strength, leadership, and a vast knowledge of arms and armor to wreak havoc in glorious combat.
                Some protect from the front lines with shields, locking down enemies while allies support the warrior
                from behind with spell and bow. Others forgo the shield and unleash their rage at the closest threat
                with a variety of deadly weapons.</p>
            <h4>Specializations</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Arms</li>
                <li>Fury</li>
                <li>Protection</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Druid</h3>
            <img src="images/Druid/Nalir.jpg" width="500 px" alt="This is a Guardian Druid">
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/character/us/area-52/nalir/">Archdruid Nalir</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Druids harness the vast powers of nature to preserve balance and protect life. With experience, druids
                can unleash nature’s raw energy against their enemies, raining celestial fury on them from a great
                distance, binding them with enchanted vines, or ensnaring them in unrelenting cyclones.</p>
            <h4>Specializations</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Balance</li>
                <li>Feral</li>
                <li>Guardian</li>
                <li>Restoration</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Shaman</h3>
            <img src="images/Shaman/Gognar.jpg" width="500 px" alt="This is an Ehancement Shaman">
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/character/us/area-52/gognar/">Farseer Gognar</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Shaman are spiritual guides and practitioners, not of the divine, but of the very elements. Unlike some
                other mystics, shaman commune with forces that are not strictly benevolent. The elements are chaotic,
                and left to their own devices, they rage against one another in unending primal fury. It is the call of
                the shaman to bring balance to this chaos. Acting as moderators among earth, fire, water, and air,
                shaman summon totems that focus the elements to support the shaman’s allies or punish those who threaten
                them.</p>
            <h4>Specializations</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Elemental</li>
                <li>Enhancement</li>
                <li>Restoration</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Mage</h3>
            <img src="images/Mage/Twistedfire.jpg" width="500 px" alt="This is a Frost Mage">
            <ul>
                <!-- Pick up here with profile links<li><a href="">Twistedfire</a></li>-->
            </ul>
            <p>Students gifted with a keen intellect and unwavering discipline may walk the path of the mage. The arcane
                magic available to magi is both great and dangerous, and thus is revealed only to the most devoted
                practitioners. To avoid interference with their spellcasting, magi wear only cloth armor, but arcane
                shields and enchantments give them additional protection. To keep enemies at bay, magi can summon bursts
                of fire to incinerate distant targets and cause entire areas to erupt, setting groups of foes ablaze.
            </p>
            <h4>Specializations</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Arcane</li>
                <li>Fire</li>
                <li>Frost</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Paladin</h3>
            <img src="images/Paladin/Anwan.jpg" width="500 px" alt="This is a Retribution Paladin">
            <ul>
                <li><a href="">Anwan</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is the call of the paladin: to protect the weak, to bring justice to the unjust, and to vanquish
                evil from the darkest corners of the world. These holy warriors are equipped with plate armor so they
                can confront the toughest of foes, and the blessing of the Light allows them to heal wounds and, in some
                cases, even restore life to the dead.</p>
            <h4>Specializations</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Holy</li>
                <li>Protection</li>
                <li>Retribution</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Warlock</h3>
            <img src="images/Warlock/Tugan.jpg" width="500 px" alt="This is a Destruction Warlock">
            <ul>
                <li><a href="">Tugan</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the face of demonic power, most heroes see death. Warlocks see only opportunity. Dominance is their
                aim, and they have found a path to it in the dark arts. These voracious spellcasters summon demonic
                minions to fight beside them. At first, they command only the service of imps, but as a warlock’s
                knowledge grows, seductive succubi, loyal voidwalkers, and horrific felhunters join the dark sorcerer’s
                ranks to wreak havoc on anyone who stands in their master’s way.</p>
            <h4>Specializations</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Affliction</li>
                <li>Demonology</li>
                <li>Destruction</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Death Knight</h3>
            <img src="images/Death Knight/Nurin.jpg" width="500 px" alt="This is a Frost Death Knight">
            <ul>
                <li><a href="">Nurin</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>When the Lich King’s control over his death knights was broken, his former champions found their new
                purpose as Knights of the Ebon Blade. After Bolvar Fordragon donned the helm to keep the undead Scourge
                contained, he called forth a new generation of death knights to join the Ebon Blade's cause.</p>
            <h4>Specializations</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Blood</li>
                <li>Frost</li>
                <li>Unholy</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Hunter</h3>
            <img src="images/Hunter/Shotline.jpg" width="500 px" alt="This is a Beastmaster Hunter">
            <ul>
                <li><a href="">Shotline</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>From an early age, the call of the wild draws some adventurers from the comfort of their homes into the
                unforgiving primal world outside. Those who endure become hunters. Masters of their environment, they
                are able to slip like ghosts through the trees and lay traps in the paths of their enemies.</p>
            <h4>Specializations</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Beastmaster</li>
                <li>Marksmanship</li>
                <li>Survival</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Priest</h3>
            <img src="images/Priest/Draethalan.jpg" width="500 px" alt="This is a Shadow Priest">
            <ul>
                <li><a href="">Draethalan</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Priests are devoted to the spiritual, and express their unwavering faith by serving the people. For
                millennia they have left behind the confines of their temples and the comfort of their shrines so they
                can support their allies in war-torn lands. In the midst of terrible conflict, no hero questions the
                value of the priestly orders.</p>
            <h4>Specializations</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Discipline</li>
                <li>Holy</li>
                <li>Shadow</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Demon Hunter</h3>
            <img src="images/Demon Hunter/Felardor.jpg" width="500 px" alt="This is a Havoc Demon Hunter">
            <ul>
                <li><a href="">Felardor</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Demon hunters, disciples of Illidan Stormrage, uphold a dark legacy, one that frightens their allies and
                enemies alike. The Illidari embrace fel and chaotic magics—energies that have long threatened the world
                of Azeroth—believing them necessary to challenge the Burning Legion. Wielding the powers of demons
                they’ve slain, they develop demonic features that incite revulsion and dread in fellow elves.</p>
            <h4>Specializations</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Havoc</li>
                <li>Vengeance</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Rogue</h3>
            <img src="images/Rogue/Drazleb.jpg" width="500 px" alt="This is a Outlaw Rogue">
            <ul>
                <li><a href="">Drazleb</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>For rogues, the only code is the contract, and their honor is purchased in gold. Free from the
                constraints of a conscience, these mercenaries rely on brutal and efficient tactics. Lethal assassins
                and masters of stealth, they will approach their marks from behind, piercing a vital organ and vanishing
                into the shadows before the victim hits the ground.</p>
            <h4>Specializations</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Assassination</li>
                <li>Outlaw</li>
                <li>Subtlety</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Monk</h3>
            <img src="images/Monk/Nizhin.jpg" width="500 px" alt="This is a Windwalker Monk">
            <ul>
                <li><a href="">Nizhin</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>When the pandaren were subjugated by the mogu centuries ago, it was the monks that brought hope to a
                seemingly dim future. Restricted from using weapons by their slave masters, these pandaren instead
                focused on harnessing their chi and learning weaponless combat. When the opportunity for revolution
                struck, they were well-trained to throw off the yoke of oppression.</p>
            <h4>Specializations</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Brewmaster</li>
                <li>Mistweaver</li>
                <li>Windwalker</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Evoker</h3>
            <img src="images/Evoker/Alandezath.jpg" width="500 px" alt="This is a Devastation Evoker">
            <ul>
                <li><a href="">Alandezath</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Dracthyr Evokers were created to wield the magic of all five dragonflights, and seek to forge their own
                path in Azeroth. They can empower their draconic abilities through magic, charging up their attacks and
                unleashing them at the right moment to devastating effect, and use their superior mobility to dart in
                and out of the fray as the situation demands.</p>
            <h4>Specializations</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Augmentation</li>
                <li>Devastation</li>
                <li>Preservation</li>
